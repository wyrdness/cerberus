      "full": "Cerberus is the monstrous multi-headed dog that guards the gates of the Greek underworld. Typically depicted with three heads (though some early versions describe 50 or even 100 heads), Cerberus has a serpent for a tail and a mane of writhing snakes. As the offspring of the giants Typhon and Echidna, Cerberus is sibling to other famous monsters including the Hydra and Chimera. His primary role is to prevent the dead from escaping the underworld, not to prevent entry. Cerberus features in several Greek myths, most famously when captured by Hercules as his twelfth and final labor, and when charmed to sleep by Orpheus' music. The creature symbolizes the threshold between life and death, representing an insurmountable obstacle and the finality of death."
